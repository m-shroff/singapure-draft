    <p> Singapure is provided to local users at a more affordable price than existing brands.
        It improves access to reliable and affordable drinking water for the local population,
        adhering to ESG and SDG commitments. </p>

<div id="where_water_from" class="where_water_from">
    <p> Singapure water is a highly purified mineral water, sourced from deep in the ground near Mount Batukaru.
        The water is cleaned in our factory in Kerambitan, Tabanan using a four-step purification process.</p>
</div>

<div id="purification_process" class="purification_process">
    <p> The following processes are used to purify our water: </p>
    <ol>
        <li> Reverse Osmosis </li>
        <li> Ozonation </li>
        <li> Ultrafiltration </li>
        <li> Ultraviolet purification </li>
    </ol>
    <p> For your peace of mind, the water is also tested in our in-house laboratory two times a day
        to insure that it is clean, something that is rare in the industry. </p>
