    <p> Soft, smooth and light on the palate, our water is easy to drink,
        and very refreshing. The perfectly balanced pH of the water ensures a consistent
        taste experience. It responds beautifully to carbonation –
        in fact, the process makes the water taste even better – which is perfect
        for those who prefer bubbles in their water

    <p> WHY SINGAPURE?</p>
        <ul>
            <li> <b> Truly pure. </b> Our water is cleaned using a four-step purification process
                with no chemicals at the factory in Tabanan making it extremely hygienic.
                An on-site laboratory tests the water twice a day to ensure the purity of every gallon that leaves our premises. We store the filled gallons inside a covered warehouse to preserve the quality of water from the sun and other elements.
                All because we care about our water and we care about you</li>
            <li> <b> Children love it. </b> Children like the taste of Singapure because the water is light and smooth with a slight touch of naturally-occuring sweetness. Best of all, they will drink more water because it tastes so good</li>
            <li> <b> Ideal water with a meal. </b> Our water perfectly complements any meal, because it has a balanced and neutral flavour which will not change the taste of your food between sips. This is why Singapure is the preferred choice of many restaurants and cafes</li>
            <li> <b>Makes better-tasting coffee. </b> Coffee tastes smoother and has more depth of flavour when made with our water.  This is because TDS (total dissolved solids) in the water is the ideal range for perfect extraction, as recommended by an international body of specialty coffee manufacturers.
            </li>
            <li> <b> Good for health.</b> Our water has a balanced pH level of 7.2 so it is not overpowering and can be easily digested by everyone. </li>

        </ul>
